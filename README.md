## Short description of the scripts of the repository:

- get_fo_data.py:        it reads the hadron data in the smash collision files and
                         extracts the position and the momenta of selected hadrons
                         at chemical and kinetic freezeout
- combine_fo_data.py:    it combines the output files by get_fo_data.py
- compute_dN_fo_data.py: it computes dN/dt and similar spectra
